## 📊 Changes Overview

### Before
```
Admin User List:
- Shows "Balance" field
- No transaction records created
- Negative values cause negative balances
- No audit trail
```

### After
```
Admin User List:
- Shows "Assets Balance" (calculated sum)
- Transaction records auto-created
- Negative values handled as subtraction
- Complete audit trail maintained
```

## 🎯 How It Works

### Admin Edits Portfolio
```
1. Navigate to user
2. Edit Profits, Deposits, or Expert Trades
3. Click "Save Changes"
↓
System:
  ✅ Detects changes
  ✅ Creates transaction records
  ✅ Updates user stats
  ✅ Shows success toast
↓
User sees in transaction history
```

### Transaction Record Created
```
{
  user_id: "user-id",
  description: "+Profits Updated: Added $2,000.00",
  amount: 2000,
  type: "credit",
  status: "success",
  created_at: timestamp
}
```

### Negative Value Example
```
Current Profits: $10,000
Admin enters: -500
System calculates: $10,000 + (-500) = $9,500
Creates transaction: "-Profits Updated: Subtracted $500.00"
```
